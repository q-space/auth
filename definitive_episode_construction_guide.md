# Definitive Episode Construction Guide

This guide defines **exactly how to construct an episode** in this series.

It is written so a completely new assistant can produce a correct episode **without seeing prior examples**.

Nothing here is stylistic preference. Every rule exists to preserve:
- epistemic authority
- conversion integrity
- architectural depth
- cross-episode scalability

Deviations weaken the system.

---

## 1. Core Promise (Non‑Negotiable)

Every episode must **explicitly deliver** on the series promise:

> **The invisible architecture beneath decisions that shape power, wealth, and history.**

This promise is not marketing copy.
It must be *felt*, *named*, and *demonstrated* inside every episode.

Each episode delivers on the promise in three places:
1. The **orientation sentence** (early, explicit)
2. The **mechanism / pattern sections** (architectural explanation)
3. The **closing section** (reconnection to scale: power, wealth, history)

---

## 2. Title System (Signature Grammar)

### Title (Required)

Purpose: **Axiom‑level disruption**

Rules:
- Short
- Declarative
- Attacks a foundational faculty (seeing, knowing, deciding, certainty, etc.)
- No explanation
- No qualifiers

Examples:
- *Seeing Isn’t Neutral*
- *Certainty Creates Blindness*
- *Thinking Isn’t Enough*

---

### Subtitle (Required)

Purpose: **Name the invisible mechanism**

Rules:
- Explains *why* the title is true
- References hidden structure, not outcomes
- Still declarative
- No advice

Examples:
- *Unseen filters decide before you do*
- *What feels obvious is already edited*

---

### CTA Line (Required)

Purpose: **Invitation to inspect, not command**

Rules:
- Verb‑led
- Curiosity‑based
- No urgency
- No benefit claims

Allowed verbs:
- discover
- understand
- examine

Examples:
- *Discover how*
- *Understand why*

This CTA appears **once per episode** under the subtitle.

---

## 3. Opening Paragraph (Unlabeled)

Purpose: **Epistemic ignition**

Rules:
- No section header
- No meta commentary
- No explanation yet
- Written as observation, not teaching

Function:
- Destabilize false neutrality
- Establish seriousness
- Pull the reader inside before structure appears

---

## 4. Orienting Metadata Block (Canonical Order)

Appears **after the opening paragraph**, never before.

Exact order:

```
Module X — [Module Name]
Principle X — [Principle Name]
Episode X — [Episode Title]

Core Idea: [Single‑sentence distillation]
```

Rules:
- No publish dates
- No parentheses or internal codes
- Clean typography

---

## 5. Orientation Sentence (Mandatory)

Immediately follows the metadata block.

Purpose:
- Orient the reader
- Explicitly deliver the core promise
- Prevent drop‑off without spoiling structure

Rules:
- One sentence only
- No bullets
- Mentions power / wealth / history explicitly
- Describes *movement* of the episode

Example:
> *This episode moves from clarity to consequence — revealing how unseen perceptual architecture shapes decisions that compound into power, wealth, and historical outcomes.*

---

## 6. Section Taxonomy (Fixed Labels)

Major sections use **fixed labels**.
Only the second half of the heading changes.

Canonical labels:
- **The Invisible Filter Problem** (or equivalent problem framing)
- **Parable —** [Story Title]
- **Pattern —** [Architecture Name]
- **Neuroscience —** [Mechanism Description]
- **Failure Mode —** [Specific Breakdown]
- **Framework —** [Operational Architecture]
- **Closing —** [Consequential Framing]
- **Access — Tools, Work, and Continuation**

Do not invent new label types without intent.

---

## 7. Extractable Block Quotes (Mandatory)

Each major section must include **one block quote**.

Purpose:
- Standalone value
- Extractable for distribution
- Lens on power, not advice

Rules:
- Non‑obvious
- Not a summary
- No clichés
- No motivational tone

Think: *portable architecture*

---

## 8. Parable Section (Style Lock)

Purpose: **Demonstrate architecture at scale**

Rules:
- Real historical or real‑world case
- Calm, journalistic tone
- Short declarative sentences
- Pressure toward consensus must appear
- Outcome explained without moralizing

End the parable by reconnecting explicitly to **architecture**, not heroism.

---

## 9. Pattern Section (P‑Label Rule)

Purpose: **Abstract the mechanism**

Rules:
- Label starts with **P** (Pattern, Process, Principle, etc.)
- Explains how decisions are shaped *before* choice
- Uses exactly **three bullet points** when listing structure

This is where architecture becomes explicit.

---

## 10. Neuroscience Section (Substrate Requirement)

Purpose: **Ground the architecture biologically**

Rules:
- No pop neuroscience
- Use modern concepts (predictive processing, salience, top‑down modulation)
- Explain why the mechanism exists
- Tie efficiency → blindness

This section earns intellectual credibility.

---

## 11. Failure Mode Section

Purpose: **Re‑center the reader**

Rules:
- Shows how intelligent people fail
- No blame
- No advice
- Escalates stakes quietly

This is where relevance becomes personal.

---

## 12. Framework Section

Purpose: **Operational architecture**

Rules:
- Describes inspection, not optimization
- Uses exactly **three steps** when structured
- Avoids self‑help language
- Positions framework upstream of decisions

Frameworks change visibility, not outcomes directly.

---

## 13. Closing Section

Purpose: **Reconnect to scale**

Rules:
- Explicitly reference power, wealth, and/or history
- Emphasize upstream causality
- No summary recap
- End with a constraint or reorientation

---

## 14. Access Section (Canonical Ending)

Title: **Access — Tools, Work, and Continuation**

Purpose:
- Provide paths forward without pressure
- Preserve authority
- Support monetization without selling

Rules:
- Hyperlink placeholders allowed (…here)
- Multiple paths (archive, tools, advisory, brands, support)
- Calm tone

End with:
- a statement rejecting funnel logic
- a brief teaser of the next episode’s idea

---

## 15. Global Constraints (Series‑Wide)

- Bulleted lists: **exactly three items** only
- No “should,” “mistake,” or self‑improvement framing
- No outlines or tables of contents
- Structure must feel inevitable, not explained
- Architecture over advice, always

---

## Final Instruction

Every episode should feel like:
- a lens being installed
- not a lesson being taught

If an episode cannot deliver real architectural depth, it should not be published.

This guide is the system.
The episodes are instances.
